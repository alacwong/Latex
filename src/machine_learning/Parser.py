# Library to parse 2D mathematical objects

# Recursively iterate through symbols as a best first search
# Add check if you can add any nodes, to the tree through
# our cost function, if not, branch dies,
# how to select next stroke .. check every stroke and evaluate
# have a threshold for both, and check all
# check position, and does it make sense
# which root to check?
# use dp on sub expressions
# try tree struct for combining expressions
# generate each expression first,
